// ~~~~~ Variables ~~~~~

let count = 3


// 1. Create a variable, myAge, and set it's value to your age
// 2. Log the myAge variable to the console

let myAge = 27

console.log(myAge)

// ~~~~~ Mathematical Operations ~~~~~~

// +, -, *, /; You can do whatever operation you want, for example:

let add = 5 + 6 //in console.log(add), is equal to 11

// 1. Create two variable, myAge and humanDogRatio
// 2. Multiply the two together and store the result in myDogAge
// 3. Log myDogAge to the console

//myAge is already created.
let humanDogRatio = 7

let myDogAge = myAge * humanDogRatio

console.log(myDogAge)

// ~~~~~ Reassigning & incrementing/decreasing ~~~~~

//There are two ways to do this, the first is the classic, you mention again the variable and if you want to increment or decrease the value

let conteo = 5

conteo = conteo + 10 // equal to 15

//And my favorite, I don't how is called, but for me is the easy way

conteo += 20 //Equal to 35 (the past 10 value were counted)


// 1. Create a variable. bonusPoints. Initialize it as 50. Increase it to 100.
// 2. Decrease it down to 25, and then finally increase it to 70.
// Console.log the value after each step

let bonusPoints = 50

bonusPoints += 50

console.log(bonusPoints)

bonusPoints -= 75

console.log(bonusPoints)

bonusPoints += 45

console.log(bonusPoints)
